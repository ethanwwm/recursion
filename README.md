# Program title:
Recursion

# Description:
This program displays the different ways we can use recursion and overloading in Java. 

# Methods:
String repeat (String string, int times):
Returns a string that is repeated as many times as needed through recursion (in this case, given through parameter "times")

boolean contains(String string, char character):
Returns true if specified character is found in the string passed down. Returns false if either the string is empty or character is not found. 

int fibonacci(int n):
Returns the nth Fibonacci number. 

int multiply(int x, int y):
Returns the product of x and y using recursion. 

int power(int base, int exponent):
Returns the result of a base to a power.

double power(double base, int exponent):
Displays the use of overloading. Returns the result of a base to a power.

int gcd(int x, int y):
Returns the common denominator between two integers.

boolean isPalindrome(String phrase):
Returns true if the string is a palindrome and false otherwise.
